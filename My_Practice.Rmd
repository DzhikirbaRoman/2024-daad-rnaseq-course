## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






```{r}
c(2,5,6,7,8) %in% c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

# Check values from one vector present in another vector
# Return Index 
a <- c('A','B','C','D','E')
b <- c('C','D')
!(a %in% b)
which(a %in% b)
which(a %in% b)

```





```{r}
# Check value in a list
67 %in% list(2,5,8,23,67,34)
45 %in% list(2,5,8,23,67,34)
# Check values from one list present in another list
# Compare two lists
li1 <- list(2,5,8,23,67,34)
li2 <- list(1,2,8,34) 
li2 %in% li1
