Investigation Title	Transcriptomic signatures of progressive and regressive liver fibrosis and portal hypertension
Experiment Description	Persistent liver injury triggers a fibrogenic program that causes pathologic remodelling of the hepatic microenvironment (i.e., liver fibrosis) and portal hypertension. The dynamics of gene regulation during liver disease progression and regression remain understudied. Here, we generated hepatic transcriptome profiles in two well-established liver disease models at peak fibrosis and during spontaneous regression after the removal of the inducing agents. We linked the dynamics of key liver disease readouts, such as portal pressure, collagen proportionate area, and transaminase serum levels, to most differentially expressed genes, enabling the identification of transcriptomic signatures of progressive vs. regressive liver fibrosis and portal hypertension. These candidate biomarkers (e.g., Scube1, Tcf4, Src, Hmga1, Trem2, Mafk, Mmp7) were also validated in RNA-seq datasets of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Finally, deconvolution analysis identified major cell types and suggested an association of macrophage and portal hepatocyte signatures with portal hypertension and fibrosis area in both models.

Protocol Description	Animal experiments were performed in accordance to the approval by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Science and Research (BMBWF-V/3b/2020-0.398.007). The organs of Mus musculus C57BL/6J were collected after acquiring the study measurements and following euthanasia under anesthesia between mid-May and mid-June 2021, and stored at -80°C prior to RNA extraction. 	Each sample represents total RNA from murine liver, extracted using QIAGEN RNA Easy Mini Kit, and stored in -80°C prior to submission.	The library preparation was done with a TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT sample preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA). 	Samples were diluted, pooled into next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries in equimolar amounts, and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 4000 Systems (single-end, 50bp).	Fibrosis was induced by the administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or thioacetamide (TAA). CCl4 was gavaged as a 20% v/v solution in olive oil at a dose of 2 mL/kg body weight three times a week. TAA was injected intraperitoneally in 0.9% saline at a dose of 150 mg/kg thrice a week. The dose was gradually increased over the first week for CCl4 administration and over the first two weeks for TAA administration. The total time of fibrosis induction was 12 weeks, followed by one or two weeks of regression. 	Count normalization with variance stabilizing transformation was performed using DESeq2 method.	The alignment was performed to Mus musculus GRCm38/mm10 Reference Genome Assembly
